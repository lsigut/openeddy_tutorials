# openeddy_tutorials

## Overview

R Markdown interactive tutorials for [openeddy
package](https://github.com/lsigut/openeddy). Isolated use-cases
involving a small set of `openeddy` functions are demonstrated on a data
set. These include:

- Read and write data with units

- Merging data and filling gaps in timestamp

- Plot types for viewing time series data

- Flagging and removal of spurious measurements

- Aggregation of gap-filled data and uncertainty evaluation

Although the primary focus of `openeddy` is on eddy covariance data, the
use-cases could be handy also for similar types of data, e.g. chamber
measurements, sap flow, etc.

A quick summary of openeddy and related resources is available in a form
of a poster: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8159040>. For the example
of whole eddy covariance post-processing chain see
[EC_workflow](https://github.com/lsigut/EC_workflow).

## Installation

1.  Download the example data set “KrP16.csv” from Zenodo:
    <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7845893>

2.  Download the
    [openeddy_tutorials.Rmd](https://github.com/lsigut/openeddy_tutorials/blob/master/openeddy_tutorials.Rmd)
    file to the same folder as the data set

3.  Open the `openeddy_tutorials.Rmd` with RStudio
