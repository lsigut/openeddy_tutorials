# openeddy_tutorials

You can download the example data set “KrP16.csv” from Zenodo using this
link: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7845893>. The example data set is
stored there to overcome the file size limitation of GitHub. For
up-to-date tutorials see the current version of “openeddy_tutorials.Rmd”
here on GitHub. Keep both files in the same folder for the tutorials to
run successfully.
